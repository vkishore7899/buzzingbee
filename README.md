# Short description
Problem statement:
	Earthquakes are one of the major catastrophe and their unpredictability causes even more destruction in terms of human life and animal life, including changes in geologic features, damage to man-made structures and financial forms. The damage is not caused by the quake itself but by the collapse of buildings with people inside them.	
	 The types of impacts depend to a large degree on where the earthquake is located: whether it is predominantly urban or rural, densely or sparsely populated, highly developed or underdeveloped.

How can technology help?
	Although significant progress has been made in understanding the seismic activity and also in few technologies which predicts the earthquake but still we don’t have a satisfactory way and not so effective technology to handle the situation. 

The Idea:
Gathering all the historical earthquake data, there is a possibility to predict the upcoming disaster in a specific area.

The Idea:

Old technology:
 The old technology gives the magnitude of the amount of earthquake that occurred in a specific region by using a seismometer.
Seismology lies at the core of earthquake science because its main concern is the measurement and physical description of ground shaking. The central problem of seismology is the prediction of ground motions from knowledge of seismic-wave generation by faulting (the earthquake source) and the elastic medium through which the waves propagate (Earth structure).

Current technology:
	The current technology predicts the occurred earthquake after it has reached the surface. The technology used now a days detected the wave after it is produced and helps us to estimate the magnitude of the earthquake and it gives us just few second before the impact.

Data:
	The data is fetched from a third party, where it includes each detail of an earthquake such as magnitude, latitude and place. This data will give useful information about the pattern of occurrence of the earthquake.

Watson Studio:
	IBM Watson Studio helps data scientists and analysts prepare data and build models at scale across any cloud. With its open, flexible multi-cloud architecture, Watson Studio provides capabilities that empower businesses to simplify enterprise data science and AI. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create and train machine learning models.

DB2:
	DB2 is a database product, family of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). DB2 is designed to store, analyze and retrieve the data efficiently. DB2 product is extended with the support of Object-Oriented features and non-relational structures with XML. It is a stored database, a cloud storage of IBM.

B Analyzer:
	It analyzes the old technology, and the current technology and our data to store, move the analyzed data. It basically examines the data and tries to find patterns and relationships. A self-developed code and used for the given output expected. It takes the useful information and filters the data and provides the proper output for a better understanding of the reason of occurs. This is major part which is directly proportional to the output accuracy.



Bee code:
	This helps in erasing the unwanted data and use the effective data for our prediction. This piece of code is written in Python. This encloses our prediction algorithm. This part is the major part as the output is generated in this part. This code also generates the code version to user interactive for the usability .It works on Python framework.
	
BBS:
 	This is the software built and designed by our team “Buzzing Bees”. This gives the analyzed data combined with our algorithm as the result. The algorithm is specially designed for this purpose of user interactivity and connectivity of the people with our project.

Bee.earth.html:
	One the method of connectivity with the people is webpage. Completely developed by the team and very interactive platform for the users to have the notification of any future alerts regarding earthquake. 

Bee APP:
	One the method of connectivity with the people is mobile application. Completely developed by the team and very interactive platform for the users to have the notification of any future alerts regarding earthquake.

	










Buzzing Bee Platform Summary:
The Problem:
•	Earthquakes: Nature's most unpredictable and one of the most devastating natural disasters. Some of the common impacts of earthquakes include structural damage to buildings, fires, damage to bridges and highways, initiation of slope failures and tsunami.
•	The damage is not caused by the quake itself but by the collapse of buildings with people inside them. When high intensity earthquakes strike they can cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damaged property and economical loss too.
•	Earthquakes pose inevitable risks to everyone who lives in a seismically active region. Even though the hazard is well recognized, no one knows when an earthquake will strike or how severe it will be.
•	A lot of people get killed and injured. Many people lose their money and property. It affects the mental health and emotional health of people.



 
The Solution:
1.	Buzzing Bee precautious alarm:
To the people who are using Buzzing Bee method (apk or web), we intend to share alert alarm pre-timed to the disaster. By doing so, Buzzing Bee gives people the earthquake warning and it gives them enough time to leave their properties or to evacuate their places. This saves lives of people. Individuals can use our app to reduce the amount of injuries and fatalities that an earthquake can cause.

2.	Buzzing Bee is more reliable:
Buzzing Bee works based on the algorithm which have been proved in showing results which is outstanding to any software built before which gets better and better with every update. Buzzing Bee team is available for any information or confusion of the people to be cleared. Our motive is to have the people the information to get them to safety before the catastrophe hits and making people to be prepared. 

3.	Buzzing Bee is compatible:

The software can run on any modern platform and is very simple and interactive with the users. We have a webpage version and a mobile (app) version to reach it to maximum number of people globally. We intent to use more method to communication with all possible person for the information/alert to reach them in future.

4.	Buzzing Bee is communicative:
Buzzing Bee is user friendly, easy to use, simple and that the users can rely on any ways of our communication with the people. It is easy to start with the app and understand how to use it. It is mobile compatible and is accessible to all users. It is interactive and affordable.
